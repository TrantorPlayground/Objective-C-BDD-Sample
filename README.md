# Objective-C-BDD-Sample

1. Created a new ios project in objective C
2. Used instructions in https://github.com/pivotal/cedar/wiki/Installation for seting up Cocoapod and Cedar
  
  Gotchas: Use the generated Objective C BDD Sample.xcworkspace instead of default Objective C BDD Sample.xcodeproj after installing cocoapod
